# spam-sms-classification-app
I have created a model using the 'Spam SMS' data available on UCI Machine Learning site to classify SMS as 'spam' or 'not spam'.

**Dataset link:** https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/228/sms+spam+collection

**Install the necessary libraries:** nltk, scikit-learn
To install run the following commands in your terminal:
  'pip install nltk'
  'pip intall scikit-learn'

The app uses Multinomial Naive Bayes to classify spam SMS.
